      "personId": 1,
      "id": 1
    },

  * The client has all the step history for a user so to implement this is not a big deal
* Implement some community features so people can share their results and help motivate their friends to push their limits
* Add new measurements

## Heroku deployment

For Heroku deployment I used this buildpack: [heroku-buildpack-ant](https://github.com/IntroSDE/heroku-buildpack-ant)

Created the applications with this command:  
```
heroku apps:create ServiceName --region eu --stack cedar --buildpack https://github.com/IntroSDE/heroku-buildpack-ant.git
```

This way the program had the name I wanted not some random generated name, was created in the EU region which makes response times better and uses the cedar stack with our ant buildpack.

I published my services by using the Heroku GIT way: `git push heroku master`
